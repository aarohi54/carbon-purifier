      <h2>About the Model</h2>
      <p>
        The Carbon Purifier is an innovative model created to address the issue of air pollution caused by factory emissions. Using a smart mechanism involving a conveyor belt with carbon-absorbent cloth, our model captures carbon particles before they are released into the atmosphere. This cloth rotates and is cleaned using water, making it reusable and eco-friendly. Our aim is to promote sustainable, cost-effective, and scalable solutions to environmental challenges.

    <section id="working">
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        Our model functions in the following steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Factory emits air containing carbon particles.</li>
        <li>A cloth-based conveyor belt is placed at the exit point of the chimney.</li>
        <li>The cloth traps carbon particles as the air passes through.</li>
        <li>The conveyor rotates the cloth through a water tank.</li>
        <li>In the tank, the carbon is washed off, making the cloth clean and reusable.</li>
        <li>The collected carbon can be disposed of or potentially reused in other processes.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>Why This Model is Important</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduces carbon emissions from factories.</li>
        <li>Encourages reuse of materials and sustainable practices.</li>
        <li>Low cost and low maintenance design.</li>
        <li>Uses common materials, making it accessible for real-world application.</li>
        <li>Helps educate people on pollution control and climate action.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="team">
      <h2>Our Team</h2>
      <p>
        This model has been developed by four passionate students from <strong>Jayshree Periwal High School</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dhanya Sharma</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Dia Bhatia</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Raghavi Sonkiya</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Aarohi Agarwal</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We believe in creating innovative solutions that have a real impact on the world around us. Through teamwork, creativity, and scientific thinking, we built this model with the hope of contributing towards a cleaner planet.
      </p>

    <section id="future">
      <h2>Future Scope</h2>
      <p>
        Our current model is designed on a small scale to demonstrate the concept. However, it has the potential to be implemented on a larger industrial scale with real-time carbon capturing and processing systems. Future upgrades could include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Automation and sensor-based carbon detection.</li>
        <li>Use of advanced filtering materials.</li>
        <li>Data tracking for emission levels.</li>
        <li>Integration with factory control systems for auto-cleaning cycles.</li>
      </ul>
